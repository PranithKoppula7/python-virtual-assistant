# python-virtual-assistant
Python assistant to perform basic tasks based on voice and text-to-speech interaction

Based on https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/Virtual-Personal-Assistant-using-Python/blob/master/functions/online_ops.py

Added additional functionality, such as waiting rather than timing out pause threshold and speaking, and the ISS location data interactively put through the cli.
